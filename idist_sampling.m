% Performs tensorial inverse transform sampling from an additive mixture of
% tensorial induced distributions, generating M samples. The measure this
% samples from is the order-Lambdas induced measure, which is an additive
% mixture of tensorial measures. Each tensorial measure is defined a row of
% Lambdas. The dimension d of the problem is inferred from size(Lambdas, 2).
%
% The function univ_inv is a function handle that inverts a univariate order-n
% induced distribution. It must support the syntax
%
%    univ_inv( u, n )
%
% where u can be any size array of elements between 0 and 1, and n is a
% non-negative integer.
%
% The second calling syntax sets M = size(Lambdas, 1), so that Lambdas already
% repesents randomly-generated multi-indices.

% Basic strategy:
